# Style-it
The Look Gallery is an integral part of the Style-It feature within StyleCanvas, designed to inspire and empower Gen-Z users to creatively express their fashion choices.

It acts as a personalized digital gallery where users can save, view, and showcase their styled outfits or looks in a visually engaging way.

Instead of just shopping for individual pieces, users can curate full outfit looks — combining tops, bottoms, accessories, and footwear into a cohesive style board.

Core Idea:
🎨 Create & Capture:
Users style an outfit using the Style-It feature (like mixing and matching clothes) and save their created look.

🖼️ Visual Display:
Saved looks appear in a gallery format — either as a scrollable feed or a tiled grid — giving users a portfolio of their favorite outfit styles.

🛍️ Inspiration Hub:
Users can revisit their gallery anytime for outfit inspiration, mix and match old looks, or even share them with friends or on social media.

🌟 Personal Expression:
It’s not just shopping — it’s about expressing your own style journey. Users see how their style evolves over time in a creative and fun way.
